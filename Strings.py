# In this module i am working on some basic bioinformatics concepts such as
# working on bio sequences
dna = "atgcccgcgcgatagagatatagcgacacgacgatcatc"
print(dna.count("c"))  # to find the number of specific strands in DNA

# and for the position or location we use
print(dna[-1])  # for the last position
print(dna[0])   # for the 1st position
print(dna[:3])  # upto 3 sequeces start from 0
print(dna[1:11])  # sequences between 1 to 11
print(dna[5:])   # every letter after first 5 letters
# some other functions are

# length function
print(len(dna))   # it tells the total length of the string
